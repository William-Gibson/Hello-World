# Hello-World

We're excited to begin working with the Github community...

Simply put, our purpose is to provide the next generation of practical sustainable living options to the world through all of what we do and offer. We strive to serve this purpose through our on-going work to expand on each of our program's product and service libraries.

Each of our programs are focused on developing a wide variety of innovative products, assemblies and supporting services geared toward closing the sustainability loop for individuals and communities both on and off-Earth while also using them to open up reasonable access to affordable space-bound living, employment and real estate opportunities to the general public.

We aspire to provide an extensive library of adaptive 3D printable products and remote support services in the areas of; off-world transportation/delivery, habitation, communications, agriculture, entertainment, and more. Our Sol Survivors game is how we intend to demonstrate how we want to help the world reach beyond Earth's environment to thrive off-world.
